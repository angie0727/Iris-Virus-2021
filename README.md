#### ARTIST STATEMENT

“Iris Virus” is a stop-motion animated mini-film based on a fiction story. The story is about an Iris becames conscious and was jealous of a girl's identity of being a human. Iris then successfully invaded in the girl's body by releasing 'Iris Virus'. But no matter what kind of body she is in, she is just an Iris.  At the end of the story, as Iris’s body withered, the girl's body also began to rapidly age and eventually, Iris turned into a wisp of smoke and dissipated.
       
       
This story is actually a satire of a series of events that happened in reality - the college entrance examination substitution incident.
In 2004, Chunxiu Chen was originally admitted to Shandong University of Technology with a score of 546 in the college entrance examination. Instead, the admission letter fell into the hands of another girl. 
Without a college degree, she looked for jobs only in the direction of factories and restaurants. For the next 16 years, Chen worked as an assembly line worker in a factory, and also served dishes in a restaurant to make a live.
However, the girl who took Chen's place lived in a prosperous part of the city, was a full time employee of a company, earning at least twice as much as Chen and and had a nice car. She lived and worked in the same city for more than a decade under Chunxiu Chen's name.


Until May 2020, 36-year-old Chen Chunxiu took the adult college entrance examination. When she inquired about her school registration information on the academic network, she found that it showed that she graduated from Shandong University of Technology. She then realized that her grades were substituted 16 years ago.
Then, Chen started the process of defending her rights. But when she approached the Education Bureau, she was asked to prove that she was herself. The incident was exposed by the media and attracted widespread attention. 
      
   On June 20th, 2020, Shandong Province set up a joint investigation team.
   May 26th, 2020, Shandong University of Technology proved after checking that her academic records had been substituted.
                   Subsequently, colleges and universities in Shandong Province identified 242 people suspected of being enrolled under false names.
   May 29th, 2020, the investigation team announced the results: A rich father and an uncle who is a township chief and other interests intertwined 29 people conspired with the school, education commission, public security and government.
      
      
Fate of 242 innocent students was changed by these people. And there might be more cases...

"Education is the most basic fairness, mapping the success of social civilization. A thin letter of admission may change the fate of a child or a family, which can be as heavy as a mountain. The most important thing is that the people who have the audacity to subvert the fairness of education and erode the rights of others for their own selfish desires should be punished most severely."
                                                                                                                        -- 《China Youth Daily》
                                                                                                                        
Nowadays, related government departments are strictly checking the incidents of substitution in examinations. But the lives of those who were once substituted have also passed along with time. For the victims, it is not the era that sacrificed them, but the shameles survival of some people.
      
      
So, in this film, Iris is an analogy of the people who are stealing achievements from others. The virus stands for the dirty tricks those people use to achieve their goals. But I believe there is always fairness and justice in this world. Those who do evil will always be punished by the law. As bystanders, I hope we not only treat what really happened around us as a serial, but also burn the joy, anger, sympathy and other emotions for those characters into our hearts. I also hope that we will praise the true beauty of humanity, to bravely expose and criticize in the face of darkness and ugliness, to speak out sensibly for the weak, and to be full of compassion for the unfortunate. Society will definitely be more orderly because of our concerted efforts, all structural problems will definitely be solved slowly, and the pattern of inequality that should not exist will definitely be improved.
