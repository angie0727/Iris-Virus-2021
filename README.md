#### ARTIST STATEMENT

 Iris Virus is a stop-motion animated mini-film based on a fictional story. The story is about an Iris that became conscious and grew. She was jealous of a girl's identity of being a human. Iris then successfully invaded in the girl's body by releasing the 'Iris Virus'. However, no matter what kind of body she is in, she is ultimately just an Iris.  At the end of the story, as Iris’s body withered, the girl's body also began to rapidly age until eventually, Iris turned into a wisp of smoke and dissipated.
                       
     
This story is actually a satire to a series of events that happened in reality – known as the college entrance examination substitution incident.


In 2004, Chunxiu Chen was admitted to Shandong University of Technology with a score of 546 in the college entrance examination. Instead, the admission letter fell into the hands of another girl. 


Without a college degree, Chen could only look for jobs in factories and restaurants. For the next 16 years, Chen worked as an assembly line worker, and also as a server in a restaurant to make a living.
However, the girl who took Chen's place lived in a prosperous part of the city, was a full-time employee of a company, earning at least twice as much as Chen and and had a nice car. She lived and worked in the same city for more than a decade under Chunxiu Chen's name.


In May 2020, 36-year-old Chen Chunxiu took the adult college entrance examination. When she inquired about her school registration information on the academic network, she found that it showed that she graduated from Shandong University of Technology, realizing that her grades had been stolen.


Chen then started the process of defending her rights. 
When she approached the Education Bureau, she was asked to prove that she was herself. 
The incident was exposed by the media and attracted widespread attention. 


      
On June 20th, 2020, Shandong Province officially set up a joint investigation team.
On May 26th, 2020, Shandong University of Technology proved after investigation that her academic records had been stolen.
Subsequently, colleges and universities in Shandong Province identified 242 people suspected of being enrolled under false names.
 On May 29th, 2020, the investigation team announced the results: A rich father and an uncle who is a township chief and 29 people conspired with the school, education commission, public security and government.
      
      
Fate of 242 innocent students was changed by these people.
And there possibly be more cases...



"Education is the most basic fairness, mapping the success of social civilization. A thin letter of admission may change the fate of a child or a family, which can be as heavy as a mountain. The most important thing is that the people who have the audacity to subvert the fairness of education and erode the rights of others for their own selfish desires should be punished most severely."
                                                                                                                        -- 《China Youth Daily》


                                                                                                                        
Nowadays, related government departments are closely watch for incidents of identity theft in examinations. But the lives of those who were once substituted have also passed along with time. For the victims, it is not the era that sacrificed them, but the shameless survival of some people.
      
      
So, in this film, Iris is an analogy of the people who are stealing the work and achievements from others. The virus can be viewed as for the extreme behaviors those people use to achieve their goals. I believe there can always be fairness and justice in this world. 


As people, I hope we act with empathy to those affected, encourage the true beauty of humanity in the face of darkness and ugliness, and stand up for vulnerable individuals.
Our concerted efforts could strive for a more perfect, more aware and more just society.
